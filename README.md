An [AzerothCore](https://www.azerothcore.org/) module (WotLK 3.3.5a) that adds **account-wide
Legacy progression**: your characters earn Legacy Points by leveling, and every character on
the account spends from that same shared pool to raise ranks in 3 small perk trees.

## What it does

- **Earn**: leveling up credits Legacy Points to the account (any character's level-ups add
  to the same pool).
- **Spend**: each character independently chooses which perks to raise, but every character
  draws from the ONE account-wide pool: the account can never have spent, in total across
  every character, more than it has ever earned.
- **Apply**: bought perks are re-applied automatically on login and immediately after every
  buy/reset.

```
.legacy                    - show available points and every tree/node/rank
.legacy buy <tree> <node>  - spend a point to raise a node by one rank (1-based indices)
.legacy reset              - refund every node THIS character has bought
```

Each node has up to rank 3. Raising a node costs 1 / 2 / 3 Legacy Points for rank 1 / 2 / 3
(each rank's cost is on top of the previous one: 6 points total to max a node).

## The 3 trees

### Adventure

| # | Node | Effect |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Swift Boots | +move speed |
| 2 | Quick Study | +XP from all sources |
| 3 | Wanderlust | +bonus XP from area exploration (stacks with Quick Study) |

### Professions

| # | Node | Effect |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Steady Hands | +gathering skill-up rate (mining/herbalism/skinning) |
| 2 | Master Crafter | +crafting skill-up rate |
| 3 | Bountiful Harvest | +gather yield chance, **reserved, not purchasable yet** (see Limitations) |

### Resourcefulness

| # | Node | Effect |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Grave Robber | +gold looted from creatures/objects |
| 2 | Haggler | vendor buy-price discount (also nudges repair costs, see below) |
| 3 | Frugal Repairs | additional repair-cost discount (stacks with Haggler) |

## How the perks are applied

- **Swift Boots** (move speed) is carried by a single hidden, passive, server-side spell
  whose effect amount is rewritten at runtime to match the node's rank, the same technique
  several other modules on this server use for hidden stat auras. No client patch needed.
- **Quick Study / Wanderlust** (XP%) scale the XP amount directly when it is awarded.
- **Steady Hands / Master Crafter** (skill-up rate) scale the skill-up amount directly when
  a gathering/crafting skill-up is rolled.
- **Grave Robber** (kill gold%) scales the gold amount directly before it is looted from a
  creature or object.
- **Haggler** (vendor discount) hooks the same reputation-discount calculation the game
  itself uses for vendor buy prices, which is also the base of the repair-cost calculation,
  so Haggler quietly helps repair costs too.
- **Frugal Repairs** applies an additional, repair-specific discount on top of Haggler.

## Limitations

- **Earn source**: v1 only earns Legacy Points from leveling up. More sources (dungeon
  bosses, achievements, ...) are intentionally left for later.
- **Bountiful Harvest** (gather yield chance) is listed for visibility but not purchasable:
  there is no clean hook to raise a specific gathering node's yield without also affecting
  unrelated creature loot rolls. A future revision may add this once a suitable hook exists.

## Configuration

`conf/mod_legacy.conf.dist`:

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `Legacy.Enable` | `1` | Master on/off switch |
| `Legacy.PointsPerLevel` | `1` | Legacy Points credited per level-step |
| `Legacy.LevelStep` | `1` | Award every N character levels |
| `Legacy.Adventure.MoveSpeed.PerRank` | `1.0` | Percent per rank |
| `Legacy.Adventure.Xp.PerRank` | `2.0` | Percent per rank |
| `Legacy.Adventure.ExploreXp.PerRank` | `10.0` | Percent per rank |
| `Legacy.Professions.GatherRate.PerRank` | `10.0` | Percent per rank |
| `Legacy.Professions.CraftRate.PerRank` | `10.0` | Percent per rank |
| `Legacy.Resourcefulness.KillGold.PerRank` | `5.0` | Percent per rank |
| `Legacy.Resourcefulness.VendorDiscount.PerRank` | `2.0` | Percent per rank |
| `Legacy.Resourcefulness.RepairDiscount.PerRank` | `5.0` | Percent per rank |

The module creates its own storage tables (`legacy_account`, `legacy_spent`) automatically on
first start. It also ships one small SQL file
(`data/sql/db-world/updates/mod_legacy_2026_09_22_00.sql`) that adds the single hidden carrier
spell used for the move-speed perk; if that SQL hasn't run yet, every perk except move speed
still works, and the module logs a warning at startup.

## Installation

Clone into your AzerothCore `modules/` directory, apply the SQL file above to your world
database, and rebuild the worldserver.

## Optional client addon

[`optionalAddon/GlobalTools_Legacy`](optionalAddon/) is an optional WoW 3.3.5a client addon
that wraps the `.legacy` chat commands in a small window with buttons. The module works fine
without it; it is purely a convenience for players. It is multi-language (English, German,
Spanish and French, auto-selected by the client locale, falling back to English) and works
standalone via `/glegacy` or as a tab inside the GlobalTools hub if that is installed. See the
[addon README](optionalAddon/README.md) for install steps. Credit for the addon goes to
Yluyan / Carlos.
